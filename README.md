### Spitfire Dashboard

This repo contains the latest code used to run the Howstrong Simulations Spitfire Mk.IX gauges with DCS.

## Dependancies
This file requires the DCS-BIOS (Skunkworks fork) and AccelStepper library.

## Use
1) Upload to Arduino Mega with the Arduino IDE. Only needs to be done once.
2) Connect all gauges to their requesite holes as per the pinout.
3) Launch DCS Bios and connect the Arduino to Bios.
4) Fly the Spitfire and enjoy the unparalleled realism provided by our replica gauges.
